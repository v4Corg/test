-A -D 	--> capital letters FORCE actions

git add -A      # take things AS they are
		# 
 
git rm    <TAB> <TAB>
	lists also directories that have been deleted from the local repo

git rm -r ArtikelStammMigration
	-> all files under "ArtikelStammMigration" are then staged as 

always: see git status








git commit 
git commit -a 		# automatically stages modified and deleted files, but NOT new ones


git checkout myTestBranch
CAUTION: this actually silently switches to that 


git reset 		- unstage all 

git clone versus checkout
---------------------------------
git clone    -> gets a remote REPO (its the SVN checkout)
git checkout -> switches to another BRANCH within a repo.
THIS MIGHT MEAN: getting it from the remote repo (if it doesnt
exist yet as local branch, or directly switching to the
existing local branch (which might be out-of-sync with the
remote repo)

git checkout origin/new
